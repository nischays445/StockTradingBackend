# Python Stock & Crypto Trading Backend Template

This is a basic template designed for a Python backend that could serve as a starting point for building a stock and cryptocurrency trading application. The project includes modules for managing stock and crypto portfolios, generating post-market reports, fetching financial news, and interacting with a database. Although not fully functional, this setup can help build a paper trading or stock trading application with a few modifications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nischays445/StockTradingBackend.git
    cd project
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Modules

### Main Controller

Located in the `main_controller` directory, this module serves as the central point for managing interactions between different components. Documentation is provided to explain its role, but you may need to expand it to include specific functionalities for trading logic, data validation, and request handling.

### News Controller

This basic template in the `news_controller` directory provides a framework for fetching and processing news information. This can be expanded to pull relevant stock and crypto news updates from sources via APIs.

### Post-Market Report Generator

The `postmarket.py` module retrieves daily changes in major stock indexes and stores the data in JSON format. This can be enhanced with additional features to provide daily summaries for a portfolio or to send updates.

### Crypto Portfolio Template

A placeholder module named `crypto_portfolio.py` for managing cryptocurrency investments. This file is currently non-functional but serves as a template for building out features to monitor and manage crypto assets.

### Stock Portfolio Template

Similarly, `stock_template.py` is a basic framework that can be expanded to manage stock investments within the application. It currently has no functional value but offers a starting point for stock portfolio management.

### Database

The `db` directory contains database files with some documentation. These can be customized or extended to store user portfolios, transaction history, and other relevant data.

## Usage

This is a template project and is not ready for production use. To begin developing, review each module and customize as needed:
1. Start by expanding the `main_controller` to integrate different components.
2. Customize `postmarket.py` to pull specific index data relevant to your application.
3. Develop the `crypto_portfolio.py` and `stock_template.py` to add functionality for tracking and updating investment portfolios.

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time data fetching for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
- Develop more sophisticated portfolio management logic for both stocks and crypto.
- Integrate with a broker API for executing paper trades.
- Expand the database schema to support detailed user and transaction data.
